# SpaceHacks Project: Interactive Space Flight Simulator

## Project Overview
An interactive web-based space flight simulator that allows users to experiment with spacecraft navigation while learning about orbital mechanics and physics. Users can control virtual spacecraft using keyboard inputs (W for acceleration, A/D for directional controls) and see the effects of their actions in a physics-accurate environment.

## Project Objectives
1. Create an educational tool that teaches users about physics and orbital mechanics
2. Develop a realistic physics engine using calculus for accurate motion simulation
3. Build an engaging, interactive user interface
4. Host the application on GitHub Pages for easy access
5. Align with the "Orbital Navigation & Flight Path Optimization" and "Space Exploration Visualizer" tracks
