# SpaceHacks Project: Interactive Space Flight Simulator

## Project Overview
An interactive web-based space flight simulator that allows users to experiment with spacecraft navigation while learning about orbital mechanics and physics. Users can control virtual spacecraft using keyboard inputs (W for acceleration, A/D for directional controls) and see the effects of their actions in a physics-accurate environment.

## Project Objectives
1. ✅ Create an educational tool that teaches users about physics and orbital mechanics
2. ✅ Develop a realistic physics engine using calculus for accurate motion simulation
3. ✅ Build an engaging, interactive user interface
4. ✅ Host the application on GitHub Pages for easy access
5. ✅ Align with the "Orbital Navigation & Flight Path Optimization" and "Space Exploration Visualizer" tracks

## Current Debug Issues
1.  **Start Simulation Button Inactive**: Clicking the 'Start Simulation' button does not initiate the simulation loop.
2.  **Spaceship Controls Unresponsive**: Pressing W, A, or D keys does not result in spacecraft movement or rotation.

### Debugging Plan

#### Issue 1: Start Button Inactivity
1.  **Verify Event Listener Attachment**: [ ]
    - Check `app.js` -> `setupEventListeners()`: Ensure a 'click' listener is correctly attached to the `#start-btn` element.
    - Confirm the listener calls `simulation.start()`.
2.  **Trace `simulation.start()` Execution**: [ ]
    - Add console logs inside `simulation.start()` in `simulation.js` to confirm it's being called.
    - Verify the `isRunning` flag logic.
3.  **Inspect `requestAnimationFrame` Call**: [ ]
    - Confirm `window.requestAnimationFrame(this.gameLoop)` is reached within `simulation.start()`.
    - Check for any errors thrown immediately after the call.
4.  **Examine `gameLoop` Execution**: [ ]
    - Add console logs at the beginning of `gameLoop` in `simulation.js` to see if the first frame callback executes.
    - Check for errors within `gameLoop` that might prevent recursion.

#### Issue 2: Spaceship Control Unresponsiveness
1.  **Verify Key Event Listeners**: [ ]
    - Check `app.js` -> `setupEventListeners()`: Ensure 'keydown' and 'keyup' listeners are attached to the `window` or `document`.
    - Confirm these listeners call a handler function (e.g., `handleKeyDown`, `handleKeyUp`).
2.  **Trace Input Handling**: [ ]
    - Check the key event handlers in `app.js`: Ensure they correctly identify W, A, D keys and call `simulation.handleInput()` (or similar).
    - Check `simulation.js` -> `handleInput()`: Confirm it correctly calls `spacecraft.startControl()` and `spacecraft.stopControl()` with the right arguments ('thrust', 'rotateLeft', 'rotateRight').
3.  **Inspect `spacecraft.update()` Call**: [ ]
    - Verify that `simulation.update()` calls `this.spacecraft.update(deltaTime, this.physicsEngine)` within the `gameLoop` in `simulation.js`.
    - Add console logs inside `spacecraft.update()` in `spacecraft.js` to confirm it's being called each frame.
4.  **Check `deltaTime` Value**: [ ]
    - Log the `deltaTime` value passed to `spacecraft.update()`. Ensure it's a positive, non-zero number.
5.  **Confirm State Changes**: [ ]
    - Log the values of `this.isThrusting`, `this.isRotatingLeft`, `this.isRotatingRight` within `spacecraft.update()` to see if control flags are being set.
    - Log `this.position` and `this.velocity` to see if they change when controls are active.

#### General Checks
1.  **Console Errors**: [ ]
    - Open the browser's developer console and check for any JavaScript errors during initialization or after clicking 'Start' / pressing keys.
2.  **Script Loading Order**: [ ]
    - Ensure all necessary JavaScript files (`config.js`, `physics.js`, `spacecraft.js`, `renderer.js`, `simulation.js`, `app.js`) are loaded in the correct order in `index.html`.
3.  **Object Instantiation**: [ ]
    - Double-check that `simulation`, `physicsEngine`, `spacecraft`, and `renderer` objects are successfully created without errors (check console logs from constructors).
