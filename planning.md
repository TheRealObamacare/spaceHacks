# SpaceHacks Project: Interactive Space Flight Simulator

## Project Overview
An interactive web-based space flight simulator that allows users to experiment with spacecraft navigation while learning about orbital mechanics and physics. Users can control virtual spacecraft using keyboard inputs (W for acceleration, A/D for directional controls) and see the effects of their actions in a physics-accurate environment.

## Project Objectives
1. ✅ Create an educational tool that teaches users about physics and orbital mechanics
2. ✅ Develop a realistic physics engine using calculus for accurate motion simulation
3. ✅ Build an engaging, interactive user interface
4. ✅ Host the application on GitHub Pages for easy access
5. ✅ Align with the "Orbital Navigation & Flight Path Optimization" and "Space Exploration Visualizer" tracks
