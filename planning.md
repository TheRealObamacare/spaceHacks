# SpaceHacks Project: Interactive Space Flight Simulator

## Project Overview
An interactive web-based space flight simulator that allows users to experiment with spacecraft navigation while learning about orbital mechanics and physics. Users can control virtual spacecraft using keyboard inputs (W for acceleration, A/D for directional controls) and see the effects of their actions in a physics-accurate environment.

## Project Objectives
1. ✅ Create an educational tool that teaches users about physics and orbital mechanics
2. ✅ Develop a realistic physics engine using calculus for accurate motion simulation
3. ✅ Build an engaging, interactive user interface
4. ✅ Host the application on GitHub Pages for easy access
5. ✅ Align with the "Orbital Navigation & Flight Path Optimization" and "Space Exploration Visualizer" tracks

## Current Debug Issue: Simulation Frame Rendering
- **Issue Identified**: Simulation only renders a single frame and doesn't continue animation
- **Debug Report**: 
  - Renderer test shows a missing "drawBody" method error (likely a method name mismatch with "drawCelestialBody")
  - The simulation starts but doesn't continue updating frames
  - NASA API integration works for fetching celestial body textures

### Debugging Plan
1. **Verify Animation Loop**:
   - Check if the gameLoop method in Simulation class is properly continuing the animation
   - Ensure requestAnimationFrame is being called repeatedly

2. **Examine Event Connection**:
   - Verify the start/pause button is correctly triggering the simulation loop
   - Check if isRunning and isPaused flags are being set correctly

3. **Inspect Renderer Integration**:
   - Make sure the renderer methods match what the simulation expects
   - Fix the method name mismatch (drawBody vs drawCelestialBody)

4. **Debug Object References**:
   - Ensure that all objects (simulation, renderer, spacecraft, etc.) are properly instantiated and referenced

### Implementation Plan
1. **Fix Method Name Mismatch**:
   - Update the renderer test to check for "drawCelestialBody" instead of "drawBody"

2. **Fix Animation Loop**:
   - Add console logging to track the game loop execution
   - Ensure the gameLoop method in simulation.js properly calls itself via requestAnimationFrame
   - Check for any conditions that might prematurely exit the loop

3. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Add try/catch blocks around critical rendering code
   - Add console logs to identify where the loop might be breaking

4. **Add Frame Counting**:
   - Add a frame counter to track how many frames are rendered
   - Implement a debug display to show the current frame count

5. **Test and Verify**:
   - Test the start button and debug buttons
   - Verify the animation continues running after implementation
   - Test the NASA API integration to ensure planets render correctly
